Automorphic number :

An automorphic number is a number which is present in the last digit(s) of its square. Example: 25 is an automorphic number as its square is 625 and 25 is present as the last digits.

Neon number:

A number is said to be a Neon Number if the sum of digits of the square of the number is equal to thenumber itself. Example 9 is a Neon Number. 9*9=81 and 8+1=9.Hence it is a Neon Number.

Magic number :

A number is said to be a Magic number if the sum of its digits are calculated till a single digit is obtained by recursively adding the sum of its digits. If the single digit comes to be 1 then the number is a magic number.

Example :

901

9+0+1=10

1+0=1

Palindrome:

Reverse of a number is also same as the original number.

Examle:

100001,

123454321.

These are perfect cubes where the sum of the number’s digits is equal to the cube root of the number.

512 = 8³ and 5 + 1 + 2 = 8

4913 = 17³ and 4 + 9 + 1 + 3 = 17

5832 = 18³ and 5 + 8 + 3 + 2 = 18

17576 = 26³ and 1 + 7 + 5 + 7 + 6 = 26

19683 = 27³ and 1 + 9 + 6 + 8 + 3 =27
